#Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to see the temperature variation over the years in the months of June and December. If you are going to be investing in a surf and ice cream shop, you want to make sure that the weather is surf and ice cream ready during the entire year. By checking the weather in two opposite seasons, we are able to see just how much the weather changes from the winter to the summer throughout the past couple of years. 

# Results:
- The maximum and minimum temperatures for both are within reason for getting a scoop of ice cream or hopping into the ocean to surf (with or without a wetsuit, your choice). Those values were 64 and 85 for June and 56 and 83 for December.
- The standard deviation was a little above 3 degrees for each month, which isn't bad at all. They both had quite a few years worth of data to make our results a little more solidified. This shows that the spread of the temperature didn't vary too much.
- The median and mean for the respective months was nearly identical, meaning that our data didn't have any crazy outliers or anything weird to skew the data. 

# Summary:
All in all, I believe that this is a good place to invest in for the shop. The weather is good year round and it doesn't seem too be changing. The weather range is within reason for this business to be prosperous and I think that the other months of the year will be in your favor as well. 
One query that I would consider doing is looking at the precipitation in these months to see if that is something that could possibly deter people from surfing or going out to get ice cream. I haven't been to Hawaii so I am not sure how the rain is over there, but I would want to make sure it doesn't pour for a good chunk of the time that I am there. Considering the weather was pretty good, you wouldn't think that rain would be an issue, but it is better to be safe than sorry. 
Another query that I would consider doing is looking at the elevation of the stations to make sure that it is giving a well rounded overview of the whole island. I would want to make sure that there are a decent amount of stations with elevations close to the ocean level because the weather at the top of a mountain is going to be a lot different than the weather near the water, where the surf and ice cream shop will most likely be located.
